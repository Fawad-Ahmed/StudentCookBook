2 Tbsp. - Butter
1 Cup - Onion, diced
1 Cup - Carrots, chopped
1 Cup - Peas
1 Cup - Mushrooms
3 Cups - Turkey
1/2 tsp - Thyme
1/2 tsp - Parsley
1/4 tsp - Salt
1/4 tsp - Pepper
1 Cup - Gravy
1/2 Cup - Heavy Cream
4 Cups - Mashed Potatoes

Directions:

Preheat the oven to 425�F/220�C . Melt butter in a large pot. Then add onions and carrots and cook until tender (about 5 minutes on medium heat). Add in peas and mushrooms and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes. Then, add in the turkey, salt, pepper, parsley, and thyme and stir until well-blended. Pour in the gravy and heavy cream, stir, and cook on low heat for 5 minutes.

Transfer to a greased baking dish or ramekins. Top with leftover mashed potatoes (use a piping bag to achieve the look of our pie). Mist with nonstick cooking spray. Place on a baking sheet and bake for 10-15 minutes until the potatoes are lightly browned and the filling is bubbly around the edges. (This may get messy, so clean up the edges before serving.) Enjoy!

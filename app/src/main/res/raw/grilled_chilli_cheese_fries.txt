1 bag of frozen french fries
1 can of chili
As much delicious cheese as your heart desires
Freshly chopped chives
Aluminum foil
Cooking spray

Directions:
Cut a 12-inch piece of aluminum foil. Place french fries onto the foil and form into a tight oval. Fold up the edges of the foil to make a secure foil packet (feel free to use two pieces of aluminum foil to make it extra secure). 

Heat up the grill on Medium-High heat. Then, place the foil packet of fries on indirect heat and cook for 20-30 minutes until the fries begin to crisp and are cooked through. Add the chili, cheese, chives, and any other toppings you love, then cover and cook for another 2-3 minutes (or until the cheese has melted). 

Serve the fries in the foil packet or (carefully) transfer them to a serving plate. 

Enjoy!
